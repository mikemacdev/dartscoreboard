# dartscoreboard
## Description
**Play darts and keep track of the score on a web page formatted for mobile devices.**

Why pay for the dart board to keep the score for you?  (Escpecially if you are a poor college student.)

Note: Only handles cricket scoring for now. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_(darts)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_(darts)) to learn about cricket.
